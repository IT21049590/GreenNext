    "Main_Description": "Monocrystalline come in PERC Technology which is Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell. PERC is the latest technique which increases its efficiency in various ways. The PERC helps in absorbing the sunlight from the frontal area and the rear surface gets the reflected sunlight.Polycrystalline or Multicrystalline solar panels are solar panels that consist of several crystals of silicon in a single PV cell.They are cheaper than monocrystalline and which makes them highly usable in various application like  street lights, traffic lights, gardens, farms etc",
